# Coding Test - Java Solutions

Hi! 👋  
This repository contains my solutions to the coding test, completed using **Java**.  
I've tried to keep each solution simple and easy to understand, with one file for each problem.

## 📁 File Overview

| File Name      | Description                            |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| `Program1.java` | Calculator (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division) |
| `Program2.java` | Generate odd numbers by count (Problem 2) |
| `Program3.java` | Generate odd numbers up to input value (Problem 3) |
| `Program4.java` | Count multiples from a list (Problem 4) |

## 🧠 Problem Summaries

### 🔹 Problem 1 - Calculator
A simple calculator that takes two numbers and an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) as input and gives the result.  
Takes care of division by zero as well.

---

### 🔹 Problem 2 - Odd Numbers (Count-Based)
Takes an integer `a` and prints the **first `a` odd numbers**.  
**Example:**  
Input = 4  
Output = `1, 3, 5, 7`

---

### 🔹 Problem 3 - Odd Numbers (Value-Based)
Prints all **odd numbers from 1 to `a`**.  
**Example:**  
Input = 5  
Output = `1, 3, 5`

---

### 🔹 Problem 4 - Count Multiples
Given a list of numbers and a base range from 1 to 9, counts how many numbers in the list are divisible by each base value.  
**Example Input:**  
`[1, 2, 8, 9, 12, 46, 76, 82, 15, 20, 30]`  
**Example Output:**  
`{1=11, 2=8, 3=4, 4=4, 5=3, 6=2, 7=0, 8=1, 9=1}`

## 📝 Notes

- All solutions are written using basic Java (no external libraries).
- I've kept the code clean and readable with comments where necessary.
- This test was done without using any online help, as instructed.
